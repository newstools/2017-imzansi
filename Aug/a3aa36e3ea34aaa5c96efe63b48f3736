No one can imagine the pain that Simphiwe feels,she can&#8217;t even say it but she however expresses it with pen and paper. Below is the poem that will leave you in tears. You&#8217;re gone, and all that&#8217;s left is nothing but memories,Memories that lead me to silence and tears.I miss your arms that hold me tight,Your snore that fills our room at night.You&#8217;re gone, and I can no longer stare at you as you sleep,But thank God, He lets me see you as I weep.In dreams we talk and laugh together.There I can say I love you more than ever.You&#8217;re gone, and I feel so weary when I&#8217;m alone.Wish you were here and would come back home.I&#8217;m hurting and longing for your touch.Why parting had to hurt this much?You&#8217;re gone forever, and we are now apart.I&#8217;m filled with pain that breaks my heart.You used to playfully sneak behind the door.Those lovely eyes I see no more.You&#8217;re gone, and I terribly miss your voice,Your laughter that fills the house with noise.Your absence makes me feel so blue.My life is empty without you.Cherish the one you love.May she be comforted during this trying times and the sad part is,they were planning to have babies from next year.Source : Online!
