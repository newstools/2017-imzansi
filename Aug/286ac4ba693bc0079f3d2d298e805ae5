Kwa-Zulu Natal socialite and dancer Zodwa Wabantu is a living testimony that working hard pays. The dancer and naturally gifted entertainer added her name to a list of South Africans who have their residential address in the posh suburb of Ballito in Durban.A Durban-based property agent who didn t want to be named because he was not allowed to go public about the purchase says he was shocked when his client arrived for their first meeting. There s no person who can claim not to know Zodwa. I am an Indian guy but I love her. I have been to Eyadini with my friends couple of times and seen how she shines on the dance floor, he said. I was shocked when she rocked up at our first meeting and indicated that she wanted to buy a house cash. I thought she was just a dancer that got paid nothing for entertaining people. I never thought she could afford a R2.5m house. I am happy for her, he added.It was reported last month in daily and weekly publications that Zodwa charges between R25 000 and R35 000 for bookings. Over the last two months she has performed all over the country, including Limpopo and North West. She has always showed her skills in SADC countries like Botswana and Zimbabwe.Messages sent to Zodwa did not receive any response.Source : Daily Live&nbsp;!
