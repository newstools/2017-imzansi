Lesotho &#8211; A le_sbian couple which is currently in police custody,had the &#8216;guts&#8217; over the weekend to record a Facebook Live video having a &#8216;good time&#8217; in toilet,a move that left them blaming on the alcohol that they had consumed since Saturday morning. Dorcus Dube,32 and Maipelo Tshabalala 29,have been described as &#8216;disciplined&#8217; longtime &#8216;lovers&#8217; back from high school and their &#8216;act&#8217; came as a surprise to many.&#8221;Although these two developed feelings back from their school days,the way that they behaved after their drinking spree is not acceptable,let alone posting such acts on giant networks&#8221;,said a friend who identified herself as Nomsa.According to another report,the couple&#8217;s friend recorded the couple &#8216;enjoying&#8217; themselves in the toilet using Dorcus&#8217; Samsung phone without her consent,a move that has angered the couple.Efforts to get comments from the couple were fruitless as they are still in police cells since Saturday night.Source : iMzansi!
